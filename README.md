# README

ESP32-WROVER-IE (IPEX) module is based on ESP32-D0WD-V3 chip, with 4MB flash 
and 8MB psram embedded. 

The project is based on idf 4.4 release with a few files patched. The patch
is not necessary for this project, but on my linux box there are several
projects being developped simultaneously. It is convenient to have a single
copy of idf source repo.
